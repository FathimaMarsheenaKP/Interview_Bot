The project leverages the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the traditional interview process within human resources. In a world where technology continues to advance, the integration of AI into interviews represents a significant paradigm shift. The primary objective is to create an innovative system that combines AI, computer vision, and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to enhance the interview experience for both
candidates and interviewers.The problem statement addressed in this project is the need for a
more efficient, fair, and data-driven approach to the interview process. Manual interviews often
suffer from subjectivity, inconsistencies, and potential biases. By harnessing computer vision
and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology, the system can accurately detect and
interpret facial emotions, thereby ensuring interview integrity. The utilization of Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe candidate responses and NLP for categorizing and
adapting questions based on performance enables a comprehensive evaluation.
The proposed system not only transforms the presentation of interview questions but also
empowers AI to analyze candidate responses, assess suitability, and provide feedback.This
streamlined approach enhances fairness, efficiency, and evaluation consistency, while providing
valuable data-driven insights. Additionally, all interview data is securely stored, ensuring
authorized access for future reference.
In essence, this project combines the strengths of AI and human resources practices to usher in
a new era of interviews, making them more equitable and efficient. It aims to create an interview
experience that benefits both candidates and interviewers by minimizing biases and maximizing
the potential for finding the most suitable candidates for job positions.
